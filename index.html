                    BeerGenie is a comprehensive drink counter and drinking habit tracker designed to help you monitor your alcohol consumption and build awareness around your drinking patterns. Whether you're at a bar, party, or home, BeerGenie helps you track every drink accurately and understand your consumption habits over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app's primary function is drink counting and session tracking. You can log drinks, view your consumption history in a calendar format, track statistics, monitor dry streaks, set personalized daily limits based on CDC guidelines, and receive water reminders. All of these core features are available by default and work independently of any optional features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BeerGenie also offers optional educational BAC estimates that you can enable in settings. These estimates are hidden by default and only appear if you explicitly choose to enable them after acknowledging appropriate disclaimers. These optional estimates are for educational and informational purposes only and should never be used to determine fitness to drive or operate machinery.

                <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
                <p>
                    BeerGenie is a mobile application that functions primarily as a <strong>drink counter and drinking habit tracker</strong>. The App's core functionality includes logging drinks, tracking consumption sessions, viewing drinking history in calendar format, monitoring statistics, tracking dry streaks, setting personalized daily limits, and receiving water reminders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The App also offers <strong>optional educational BAC estimates</strong> that are hidden by default. These optional estimates can only be enabled by users who explicitly choose to activate them through settings after acknowledging appropriate disclaimers. These optional estimates are based on general formulas and calculations that may not reflect your actual BAC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The App is provided for <strong>informational purposes only</strong> and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical, legal, or safety advice. The core drink counting and tracking features work independently of any optional features.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Age Requirement</h3>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>DO NOT use optional BAC estimates to determine your fitness to drive or operate machinery.</strong> Many factors affect BAC that are not accounted for by the App, including but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual metabolism rates</li>
                    <li>Food consumption</li>
                    <li>Medications and drug interactions</li>
                    <li>Medical conditions</li>
                    <li>Individual physiology and tolerance</li>

                <h3>BAC Estimates</h3>
                <p>
                    Blood alcohol content (BAC) estimates in BeerGenie are calculated using the Widmark formula, a widely recognized method for estimating blood alcohol content based on alcohol consumption, body weight, biological sex, and time elapsed.

                    <strong>Important Note:</strong> BAC estimates are approximations only and should not be used for medical or legal purposes. Many factors affect actual BAC including metabolism, food intake, medications, medical conditions, and individual physiology. These estimates should never be used to determine fitness to drive or operate machinery.
